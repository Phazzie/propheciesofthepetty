## Minor Issues (Low Priority)

### 5. Documentation Standards ✓
- **Severity**: Low
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution**: 
  - Standardized documentation format implemented
  - Clear type definitions with comments
  - Score range requirements documented
  - Achievement system detailed

### 6. UI Feedback System ✓

## Current System Overview

### Scoring Requirements
- Core Metrics: Minimum 80/100 (standardized from 8/10)
- Shade Level™: Minimum Level 7
- Special emphasis on Level 3-4 ("Pointed Pause") mastery

### Score Weights
- Humor: 1.2x multiplier
- Creative: 1.15x multiplier
- Subtlety/Relatability: 1.1x multiplier
- Wisdom: 1.0x base weight

### Validation Protocol
1. Check core metric base scores (pre-weight)
2. Validate Shade Level™ requirements
3. Apply special condition bonuses
4. Calculate final weighted scores

### Testing Coverage
- Unit tests for all scoring components
- Edge case validation
- Special condition triggers
- Level transition handling
- UI feedback verification

## Next Steps

### Monitoring
1. Track core metric distributions
2. Monitor Shade Level™ progression patterns
3. Analyze achievement unlock rates
4. Gather user feedback on scoring clarity

### Future Enhancements
1. Consider additional achievement tiers
2. Explore seasonal scoring modifiers
3. Implement progression tracking
4. Add detailed scoring breakdowns

*Note: All major inconsistencies have been resolved. System now provides consistent, well-documented scoring with proper validation.*

# Code Quality Issues

## Architecture Violations
- [ ] List components with circular dependencies
- [ ] Identify impure functions in pure contexts
- [ ] Note components violating single responsibility

## Type Safety
- [ ] Track unsafe type assertions
- [ ] List missing interface implementations
- [ ] Document implicit any usage

## Performance Bottlenecks
- [ ] Unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] Unoptimized database queries
- [ ] Heavy computations in render paths

## Action Items
Sorted by impact score (performance impact × frequency × fix complexity)

## Test Architecture
- [ ] Circular dependencies in test mocks
  - Impact: Flaky tests, false positives
  - Fix: Restructure test utilities, centralize mocks
  
- [ ] Inconsistent context setup
  - Impact: Failing auth tests, unreliable results
  - Fix: Create standard test wrapper with all providers

## Component Architecture
- [ ] Prop drilling in reading components
  - Impact: Hard to test, brittle code
  - Fix: Move to context or composition pattern

- [ ] Missing error boundaries
  - Impact: Cascading test failures
  - Fix: Add proper error handling and recovery

## Performance Issues
- [ ] Unnecessary rerenders in SpreadSelector
  - Impact: Poor performance in tests
  - Fix: Implement proper memoization

## Action Items (Sorted by Impact)
1. Create centralized test context provider
2. Refactor reading component hierarchy
3. Add missing error boundaries
4. Fix performance bottlenecks

## Testing Gaps
- Missing integration tests between:
  - Auth system and reading history
  - Card selection and interpretation
  - Score calculation and display
