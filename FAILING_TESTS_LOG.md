   - ✓ renders with default props
   - ✓ renders custom message
   - ❌ rotates through shade messages
   - ✓ respects size prop
   - ✓ can be left-aligned

### Context Tests
8. **AuthContext Tests** (1/1 failing)
   - ❌ hello world!

### Integration Tests
9. **Gemini AI Integration Tests** (1/2 failing)
   - ❌ generates tarot interpretation
   - ✓ handles API errors gracefully

## Common Issues
1. Module Resolution Issues: Many test failures appear to be related to module resolution problems, particularly in component tests.
2. Context Setup: Several auth-related component tests are failing due to potential context setup issues.
3. Mock Issues: Some tests may be failing due to incomplete or incorrect mocking of dependencies.

## Next Steps
1. Review and fix module resolution configuration
2. Update test setup for auth context components
3. Verify mock implementations for external dependencies
4. Focus on fixing auth component tests first as they have the highest failure rate
