## Suggested Next Steps (Prompts)

1. "Create authentication forms (login/register) with form validation"
2. "Implement the card reading interface with card selection and spread layouts"
3. "Build the user profile page with subscription management"
4. "Set up the reading history view with filtering and sorting"
5. "Create the subscription tier selection interface"
6. "Implement the admin dashboard layout"
7. "Set up the backend Express.js server with initial routes"
8. "Create the database schema and models"
9. "Implement the payment processing system"
10. "Set up the testing environment and write initial tests"

## Questions for Clarification
1. Should we implement social authentication (Google, GitHub) in addition to email/password?
2. What payment processor should we use (Stripe, PayPal, both)?
3. Should we implement real-time features (WebSocket) for live readings?
4. Do we need multilingual support?
5. Should we implement a mobile app version?

## Notes
- Keep frontend and backend in separate repositories
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Follow security best practices
- Maintain comprehensive documentation
- Regular security audits
- Performance monitoring

## Current Sprint
