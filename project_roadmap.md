# Prophecies of the Petty - Project Roadmap

## Current Status: Phase 1 - Core Features

### âœ… Completed (Last Updated: 2024)
- Project initialization with Vite + React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS setup
- Gemini AI integration
- Score normalization system (0-100 scale)
- Shade Levelâ„¢ implementation with all 10 levels
- Test infrastructure with Vitest
- Core metrics standardization
- Achievement system with passive-aggressive themes
- Loading state components
- Error boundary implementation

### ðŸš§ In Progress
- Auth component testing (13/19 failing)
- Reading interface completion (4/4 tests failing)
- Test context provider standardization
- Edge case coverage for Shade Levelâ„¢ system
- Component performance optimization

### ðŸ“‹ Immediate Priorities
1. Test Infrastructure (ETA: 1 week)
   - Create centralized test context provider
   - Fix failing auth component tests
   - Implement missing integration tests
   - Add Shade Levelâ„¢ edge case coverage

2. Component Completion (ETA: 1 week)
   - Complete reading interface
   - Fix spread selection tests
   - Implement proper loading states
   - Add error recovery paths

3. Performance Optimization (ETA: 3 days)
   - Add SpreadSelector memoization
   - Optimize card rendering
   - Implement proper component lazy loading

## Technical Requirements

### Core Standards
- TypeScript strict mode required
- 85%+ test coverage mandatory
- All async operations must have loading states
- Error boundaries required for all routes
- Performance monitoring on critical paths

### Testing Priorities
1. Authentication Components
   - Fix RegisterForm (5/8 failing)
   - Fix LoginForm (6/6 failing)
   - Complete ForgotPasswordForm (2/5 failing)

2. Reading Interface
   - Fix spread selection tests
   - Implement card interaction tests
   - Add loading state validation
   - Test error recovery paths

3. Integration Tests
   - Auth system + reading history
   - Card selection + interpretation
   - Score calculation + display

## Questions to Resolve
1. Should we implement social auth in addition to email/password?
2. What performance metrics should we prioritize?
3. Do we need real-time features for readings?
4. What analytics are most important to track?

## Notes
- Keep frontend and backend separate
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Follow security best practices
- Maintain comprehensive documentation
- Regular security audits
- Monitor performance metrics
