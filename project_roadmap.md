## Questions for Clarification
1. Should we implement social authentication (Google, GitHub) in addition to email/password?
2. What payment processor should we use (Stripe, PayPal, both)?
3. Should we implement real-time features (WebSocket) for live readings?
4. Do we need multilingual support?
5. Should we implement a mobile app version?

## Notes
- Keep frontend and backend in separate repositories
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Follow security best practices
- Maintain comprehensive documentation
- Regular security audits
- Performance monitoring
