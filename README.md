# Prophecies of the Petty *(Because sometimes the truth needs to be... delicately delivered)*

A passive-aggressive tarot reading system that tells you what you need to hear, not what you want to hear. (*We're just looking out for your best interests.*)

## Getting Started *(Since you asked...)*

```bash
# Install dependencies (You ARE using the right Node version, aren't you?)
npm install

# Set up your environment (We trust you'll add ALL the required variables)
cp .env.example .env

# Start the development server (We'll be watching the console output...)
npm run dev

# Run tests (All of them. Yes, really.)
npm test
```

## Project Standards *(Because we care about quality)*

- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled *(It's for your own protection)*
- **Testing**: 85%+ coverage required *(We're keeping track)*
- **Performance**: <100ms render target *(Users notice these things)*
- **Documentation**: Always up-to-date *(It's just common courtesy)*

## Architecture *(Carefully crafted for your success)*

The project follows a carefully considered architecture *(That we expect you to maintain)*:

- `src/components`: Reusable UI components *(Keep them pure, please)*
- `src/contexts`: React contexts *(Use them appropriately)*
- `src/hooks`: Custom hooks *(Document their purpose... thoroughly)*
- `src/lib`: Core utilities *(Think twice before modifying)*
- `src/types`: TypeScript definitions *(No any allowed)*

## Documentation *(Since you mentioned wanting to contribute)*

- **TEST_STATUS.md**: Current test coverage and issues *(Updated automatically... we're watching)*
- **ROADMAP.md**: Upcoming tasks *(Prioritized for your convenience)*
- **BLOCKERS.md**: Current blockers *(We trust you'll address these promptly)*

## Contributing *(If you think you're ready)*

1. Check **TEST_STATUS.md** first *(Always)*
2. Review **BLOCKERS.md** *(Naturally)*
3. Verify no partial implementations *(We notice these things)*
4. Write tests FIRST *(Non-negotiable)*
5. Implement feature *(Following our standards, of course)*
6. Update documentation *(It's just what good developers do)*
