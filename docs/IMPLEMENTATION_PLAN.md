# Updated Implementation Plan with Detailed "How To" Instructions

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to fix systematic issues in the project. For each major task, specific, actionable instructions are provided to ensure clarity and proper implementation until all tests pass and the codebase is stable.

---

## 1. Type System and Interface Fixes

### 1.1 Centralize Type Definitions
- **What to do:** Move all core types (e.g., `ShadeIndex`) from individual files into a single definitions file.
- **How to do it:**
  1. Open `/src/types/index.ts`.
  2. Identify local type declarations in various components and tests (e.g., in `ReadingScores.tsx` and its test file).
  3. Copy these type definitions into `/src/types/index.ts`.
  4. Update all import statements in these files to reference the centralized file.
  5. Run `tsc --noEmit` to check for type errors.

### 1.2 Fix Constants
- **What to do:** Centralize the definition of frequent constants like `SPREADS`.
- **How to do it:**
  1. Create or update `/src/types/spreads.ts` with a proper export of `SPREADS`.
  2. Replace all other instances where `SPREADS` is defined or imported from component files with an import from `/src/types/spreads.ts`.
  3. Verify by running tests that depend on `SPREADS`.

### 1.3 Resolve Circular Dependencies
- **What to do:** Refactor modules that depend on each other to eliminate circular imports.
- **How to do it:**
  1. Use your IDE to trace circular dependency warnings.
  2. Identify common functionality that appears in multiple modules.
  3. Extract shared code (e.g., utility functions or types) into a separate file.
  4. Update all affected import paths accordingly.
  5. Rebuild the project and run tests.

## 2. Test Infrastructure Improvements

### 2.1 Standardize Mocks & Utilities
- **What to do:** Consolidate and standardize test mocks and helper functions.
- **How to do it:**
  1. Review `/src/__mocks__/` and `/src/tests/helpers.ts` for duplicate or inconsistent mocks.
  2. Create a single source of truth (e.g., a file named `/src/tests/commonMocks.ts`).
  3. Replace all ad-hoc instances in individual tests with imports from this new file.
  4. Run the test suite for validation.

### 2.2 Enhance Test Coverage
- **What to do:** Fix failing tests and add coverage for edge cases.
- **How to do it:**
  1. Open each failing test file (e.g., `ShadeLevels.test.ts`, `NewTest.test.tsx`).
  2. Compare assertions in test files with current component logic.
  3. Update test expectations or modify the component behavior if necessary.
  4. Write new tests for uncovered edge cases, especially for error boundaries.
  5. Verify test improvements by checking the coverage report.

## 3. Error Handling Enhancements

### 3.1 Improve ErrorBoundary
- **What to do:** Enhance the ErrorBoundary component so it catches errors gracefully and provides diagnostic logs.
- **How to do it:**
  1. Open `/src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`.
  2. Modify the error boundary to implement `componentDidCatch` (or use error boundary hooks if using function components) that logs errors to console or an external service.
  3. Create test cases simulating child component errors to verify that the fallback UI is rendered.
  4. Check browser console for proper error logs.

### 3.2 Comprehensive Error Logging
- **What to do:** Improve error logging across the application.
- **How to do it:**
  1. Implement a logging helper in a new file (e.g., `/src/lib/logger.ts`).
  2. Integrate this logger into error handlers in components and test utilities.
  3. Test by triggering errors and verifying that logs are complete and formatted correctly.

## 4. Component Architecture and State Management

### 4.1 Refactor ReadingLayout
- **What to do:** Ensure the ReadingLayout component correctly handles layout logic and imports.
- **How to do it:**
  1. Open `/src/components/reading/ReadingLayout.tsx`.
  2. Confirm that `SPREADS` is imported from `/src/types/spreads.ts`.
  3. Refactor layout logic to use a consistent method for custom and standard spreads (e.g., separate mapping functions).
  4. Validate by manually testing the component and running the related tests.

### 4.2 Standardize State Patterns
- **What to do:** Use common patterns for handling asynchronous loading and error states.
- **How to do it:**
  1. Identify components that manage asynchronous data (e.g., ReadingInterface, LoadingSpinner).
  2. Create a custom hook (e.g., `useAsyncState`) that encapsulates the loading, error, and data states.
  3. Update the affected components to use this hook.
  4. Run tests to ensure behavior consistency.

## 5. Documentation and Code Quality

### 5.1 Enrich JSDoc Comments
- **What to do:** Add JSDoc comments to key functions, components, and types.
- **How to do it:**
  1. Go through major component files and functions.
  2. Write concise JSDoc comments describing parameters, return types, and side effects.
  3. Validate with a JSDoc linter if available.

### 5.2 Linting and TypeScript Checks
- **What to do:** Ensure code adheres to strict standards.
- **How to do it:**
  1. Update ESLint configurations (in `eslint.config.js`) to enforce strict rules.
  2. Run `npm run lint` and fix all issues.
  3. Build the project with `tsc` to ensure no type errors.

## 6. Performance Optimizations

### 6.1 Memoization and Lazy Loading
- **What to do:** Optimize component performance using memoization and lazy loading.
- **How to do it:**
  1. Identify components with expensive renders.
  2. Wrap these components with `React.memo` and use `useMemo` for derived data.
  3. Convert components with large bundles to lazy load using `React.lazy` and `Suspense`.
  4. Measure performance improvements using browser profiling tools.

### 6.2 Render Performance
- **What to do:** Minimize unnecessary re-renders.
- **How to do it:**
  1. Use performance profiling (e.g., Chrome DevTools) to identify bottlenecks.
  2. Optimize logic within render methods and lifecycle hooks.
  3. Implement conditional rendering and use Reactâ€™s `shouldComponentUpdate` or hooks like `useCallback` where applicable.

## Commitment and Next Steps

- **Commitment:** Follow the steps rigorously, validating after each major change using unit tests, integration tests, and manual review.

- **Next Steps:**
  1. Begin with Type System and Interface Fixes as described in Section 1.
  2. Run the tests (`npm test` or your test runner) after each major change to catch regressions early.
  3. Once Section 1 is stable, proceed with Sections 2 through 6 sequentially.
  4. Update all documentation as you finalize each step.

This plan must be followed until full completion of the project. Each step is designed with detailed "how to" actions, ensuring that no shortcuts or hacks are applied, and that the codebase remains robust, maintainable, and fully tested.
