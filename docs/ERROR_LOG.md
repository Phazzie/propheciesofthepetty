# Error Tracking Log

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Decorator Syntax Error
**Error Message:**
```
[plugin:vite:react-babel] Support for the experimental syntax 'decorators' isn't currently enabled
```

**Attempted Solutions:**
1. ✅ Added `@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators` package
   - Result: Partial fix but introduced new issues
   - Reason: The decorator syntax was being misinterpreted from diff syntax

2. ✅ Added Babel configuration to vite.config.ts
   - Result: Still experiencing issues
   - Reason: The root cause was actually diff syntax being misinterpreted

3. ✅ Implemented development test account bypass
   - Result: Success
   - Implementation: Added `VITE_USE_TEST_ACCOUNT` environment variable
   - Reason: Avoids authentication complexity during development

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- The diff syntax (`@@ .. @@`) was being misinterpreted as a decorator
- The issue was compounded by authentication complexity in development

**Best Solution:**
- Use development test account for local development
- Properly format diffs to avoid syntax conflicts
- Keep authentication code simple and well-documented

### 2. Authentication State Management
**Error Message:**
```
Cannot read properties of null (reading 'user')
```

**Attempted Solutions:**
1. ✅ Added loading state management
   - Result: Success
   - Implementation: Added loading spinner during auth checks
   - Reason: Prevents rendering before auth state is determined

2. ✅ Improved error handling
   - Result: Success
   - Implementation: Added custom error types and logging
   - Reason: Better error tracking and debugging

**Best Practices:**
- Always handle loading states
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use custom error types for better debugging
- Maintain comprehensive logging

## Error Prevention Guidelines

### 1. Code Quality
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Add comprehensive logging
- Write unit tests for critical paths

### 2. Development Workflow
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement feature flags for complex features
- Maintain separate development and production configurations
- Document all error handling strategies

### 3. Testing Strategy
- Write tests for error scenarios
- Test boundary conditions
- Implement integration tests for critical flows
- Use error monitoring in production

## Monitoring and Logging

### Current Implementation
- Custom logger utility
- Error tracking with context
- Development vs production logging
- Structured log format

### Future Improvements
1. Add error reporting service integration
2. Implement log aggregation
3. Add performance monitoring
4. Create error analytics dashboard

## Common Error Types

```typescript
// Reference implementation from lib/errors.ts
export class AppError extends Error {
  constructor(
    message: string,
    public code?: string,
    public details?: unknown
  ) {
    super(message);
    this.name = 'AppError';
  }
}

export class DatabaseError extends AppError {...}
export class AuthError extends AppError {...}
export class ValidationError extends AppError {...}
export class AIError extends AppError {...}
export class NetworkError extends AppError {...}
```

## Error Handling Best Practices

1. **Always use custom error types**
   ```typescript
   throw new DatabaseError('Failed to fetch cards', { error });
   ```

2. **Include context in error messages**
   ```typescript
   logger.error(
     'Login failed',
     error,
     { userId, attempt: retryCount },
     'LoginForm',
     'handleSubmit'
   );
   ```

3. **Implement proper error boundaries**
   ```typescript
   class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
     componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
       logger.error('Error caught by boundary', error, errorInfo);
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Use structured logging**
   ```typescript
   logger.error('Operation failed', {
     component: 'LoginForm',
     action: 'handleSubmit',
     error: err,
     context: { userId, timestamp }
   });
   ```
